Hi, first of all, i know that this is not the right file to right this down, but for me this was a big challenge since i have never made anything like that, i've never had to make API requests.
But still i've to tried to make something, using a diferent url than yours, since i was unable to fetch any data from your url.

For this project in particular, i used it on windows, so there was the need for me to install xampp. With that i was able to start a Laravel project.
In order to see the project in windows, use xampp control panel and activate the Apache and SQL. After that, you can navigate to the http://localhost/Laravel/Laravel/ select the public folder and voila, the view will be there. Only the button works to acess a diferent view. 

Sorry for the low work, but has i have said, never worked with API request.
Best regards,
Rui Branco
